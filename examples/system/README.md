# System Example

`system` contains sample Python code for detecting system hardware
and software resources and publishing their metadata to the
NI Measurement Data Store.

## Required Software

`system` requires Python 3.10 or greater and the
[NI System Configuration API](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.system-configuration.html).
Alternatively, install at least one NI driver like NI-DAQmx or NI-SCOPE.
